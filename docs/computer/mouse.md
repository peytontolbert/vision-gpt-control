# Mouse Class Documentation

## Overview
The Mouse class provides precise control over mouse movements and actions, with special integration for browser automation. It handles coordinate tracking, smooth movement, and click actions.

## Key Features
- Smooth mouse movement with easing
- Browser-synchronized positioning
- Thread-safe operation
- Position tracking and validation
- Click action management

## Core Methods

### Initialization
```python
mouse = Mouse(target_browser, screen, movement_speed=1.0)
mouse.initialize() # Center mouse and prepare for use
```


### Movement

```python
Smooth movement to coordinates
mouse.move_to(x, y, smooth=True) # Returns success boolean
Get current position
position = mouse.get_position() # Returns (x, y) tuple
```


### Click Actions
```python
Single click
mouse.click(button='left') # left/right/middle
Double click
mouse.click(button='left', double=True)
```


### Position Management
```python
Check if coordinates are valid
mouse.validate_coordinates(x, y)
Update internal position
mouse.update_position(x, y)
```



## Integration with Browser
- Automatically syncs position with browser's internal mouse state
- Translates coordinates between screen and browser viewport
- Ensures click actions are executed in browser context
- Maintains consistent state between mouse and browser

## Movement Constraints
- Maximum speed: 2000 pixels per second
- Minimum movement time: 0.05 seconds
- Position bounded by screen dimensions
- Movement tolerance: 2 pixels

## Thread Safety
- Position updates are thread-safe
- Concurrent operation support
- Background keep-alive mechanism
- Safe shutdown handling

## Best Practices
1. Initialize mouse before use
2. Use smooth movement for natural interaction
3. Verify movement success
4. Check position bounds before movement
5. Handle click action failures
6. Clean up resources with mouse.stop()

## Error Handling
- All methods return boolean success indicators
- Detailed logging of failures
- Automatic position recovery
- Graceful degradation of features

## Example Usage
```python
# Basic movement and click
mouse.move_to(100, 100, smooth=True)
mouse.click('left')
Complex interaction
mouse.move_to(200, 200)
mouse.click('left', double=True)
Position checking
current_pos = mouse.get_position()
if mouse.validate_coordinates(current_pos):
mouse.click('left')
```

This documentation provides:
1. Clear overview of each class's purpose
2. Detailed method descriptions
3. Integration points between components
4. Best practices for usage
5. Error handling approaches
6. Example code snippets

The documentation emphasizes how the Browser and Mouse classes work together, making it easier to implement code that uses both components effectively. The examples show common usage patterns and important considerations for reliable operation.
